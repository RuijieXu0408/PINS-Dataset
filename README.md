# PINS-Dataset
This repository is the usage page of the PINS-dataset. Since the positioning of GNSS is affected by the multipath effect in complex scenes such as urban canyons, the use of IMUs for positioning has become one of the hotspots in the field of positioning and navigation. Although there are many datasets on IMUs in the current GitHub, there are still fewer datasets on pedestrian navigation systems using foot-tethered IMUs. The data in this dataset are collected from a KERNEL-100 IMU developed by Beijing BDStar Navigation Co., Ltd. in circular flower bed and staircase scenes respectively. 

This repository is dedicated to provide a public dataset for PINS researchers, if you have any questions about using the dataset, please feel free to contact shichao.chen@ia.ac.cn.

##  1) Flatland scenario

In this dataset, the sampler walked normally around a circular flower bed with a circumference of about 27.6m, and ended the walking experiment at the same position as the start point so that the start-end position was the same, with a systematic error of about 82mm. The image of this flower bed is shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the performance of the error correction method can be evaluated based on the error between the end point and the start point of the trajectory after the experimental filtering.

## 2) Stairs scenario

This scenario is to test the inertial guidance positioning performance of a pedestrian moving up and down stairs in a scenario with altitude change. The experiment is as follows: the pedestrian walks up two 10-step staircases from the 9th floor to the 10th floor and then returns to the starting point on the 9th floor in the same way. Ideally, after the pedestrian returns to the starting point in the original way, the three-dimensional visualization results resolved by the algorithm in the host computer should also return to the original point, and the simulation image should change along the staircase trajectory. The stairs scenario is shown in fig. 2.

## Description of the data set format

This experiment mainly uses the three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope of the IMU, the sampling rate is 500Hz, and the samples are shown in Figure 3. The first three columns of data are respectively the x, y, z-axis acceleration data in the process of pedestrian movement recorded in the first three columns; the second three columns of the x, y, z-axis angular velocity movement data in the process of pedestrian movement recorded in the second three columns.
