# PINS-Dataset
This repository is the usage page of the PINS-dataset. Since the positioning of GNSS is affected by the multipath effect in complex scenes such as urban canyons, the use of IMUs for positioning has become one of the hotspots in the field of positioning and navigation. Although there are many datasets on IMUs in the current GitHub, there are still fewer datasets on pedestrian navigation systems using foot-tethered IMUs. The data in this dataset are collected from a KERNEL-100 IMU developed by Beijing BDStar Navigation Co., Ltd. in circular flower bed and staircase scenes respectively. The acquisition of this dataset was done by the Parallel Intelligent Technologies and Systems team at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This repository is dedicated to provide a public dataset for PINS researchers, if you have any questions about using the dataset, please feel free to contact shichao.chen@ia.ac.cn.
